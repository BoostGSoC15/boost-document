[section:introduction Motivation]

[warning This is not an official Boost C++ library. It wasn't reviewed and can't be downloaded from www.boost.org. This beta is available to boost community to know real interest and get comments for refinement. The intention is to submit the library to a formal review and get included as an official library, if community think that it is interesting!]
 

Boost.Document library is meant to simplify tasks related to manipulation of Office Documents in general and Spreadsheet Documents in particular. All the Current Office API's, be it LibreOffice/OpenOffice or MS Excel are not intuitive to use at all and the effort to write applications which use such API's distracts the developer from performing the core problems at hand. The idea here is to provide a simple, cross-platform and useable interface for developers to use to make their own applications which involve manipulating Excel/OpenOffice/LibreOffice sheets. Such a library will have many takers such as Students/Professors in academia, Banking/CRM softwares etc.

[section:introduction Brief Overview]

The library uses either Libre Office API or Microsoft Office API as the underlaying API to provide an easy interface to manipulate Spreadsheets. For example we can open a spreasheet document and export it to PDF format like this. Currently Exporting to PDF, XML and CSV are supported.

```
	boost::document d("file_path");
	d.open_document();
	d.export_document(boost::document_file_format::PDF);
	d.close_document();
```

We can perform other generic operations like Saving the spreadsheet etc.

A document needs to be opened first to manipulate it. It may or may not be closed as the destruction automatically triggers a close if it is open. However, closing and reopening causes buggy behaviour right now and thus should be avoided. The interface is designed to accomodate all the differences between the API's and thus uniform behaviour can be expected irregardless of the base.

Simple Sheet Operations such as inserting sheets, deleting sheets, counting the number of sheets, getting sheets by indices are currently supported. A simple example can be seen as follows. 

```

	boost::document d("file_path");
	d.open_document();
	
	boost::sheet s = d.get_sheet("Anurag");
	s.rename_sheet("Vatika");

	d.delete_sheet(0);

	d.close_document();

	for(int i = 0;i < sheet_count(); i++) {
		sheet sx = d.getSheet(i);
		sx.rename_sheet("AnuragSheet" + std::to_string(i)); 
	}

```
[warning Sheets are zero indexed irrespective of the underlaying API!]
